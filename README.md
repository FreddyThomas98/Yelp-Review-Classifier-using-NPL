This project aims to predict the rating (stars) of Yelp reviews as either good or bad using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By training a machine learning model on labeled review data, the project leverages NLP features to predict whether a review is likely to receive a high (good) or low (bad) rating. The model learns patterns in the textual data, such as sentiment, language structure, and keywords, to make predictions without explicitly using sentiment analysis algorithms. The goal is to provide businesses with a tool to automatically assess the sentiment of Yelp reviews and predict their overall rating, enabling them to understand customer feedback more comprehensively and make informed decisions to enhance customer satisfaction. This project demonstrates the application of NLP in rating prediction tasks and offers a practical solution for businesses to analyze and interpret large volumes of customer reviews effectively
